    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    

      <h2>What is STU-TEA?</h2>
      
      <p> 
        STU-TEA is a fun educational tool aiming to help learners strengthen their attention span for studying by making it fun and interactive. 
       </p>
      <p>
  Studying can be tedious and with this approach we strive to to make repetitive and reinforcement learning fun!</p>
       <p>We hope that the design, theme, and interactivity of this resource make it both an engaging and calming resource to help you launch into the night not frantically panicking but calm and focused.</p> 
       <p>
  Redefining the typical aesthetic of studying to make it more lighthearted instead of overwhelming. This is done partly by acknowledging the relationship between late-night studying and caffiene intake so we wanted to focus on our favorite lower-caffiene and calm-associated option of tea.
  </p>
      
      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <p>
        Users can input terms and definitions into the website which will be transformed into three interactive learning options.
        You can switch between conventional digital flashcards and two other games.</p>
